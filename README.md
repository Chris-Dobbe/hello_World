# hello_World
Just getting the old train started.


Hi, I'm a digital analyst who is new-ish to the world of programming.
I'd like to expand and grow my R skills, and this seemed like a great place to do that
My main motivation for using R is for improving my analytics abilities, especially
as they pertain to the digital analytics practice.
